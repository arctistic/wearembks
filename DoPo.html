                        We, the people of Darjeeling, either burn our used and unwanted clothes/shoes or we either throw them away in garbage dumps because we do not know where and whom to donate those apparels to. Moreover, we sell our children's books and copies after the end of every academic year for peanuts because we do not know any better to do with them.
                        <br><br>
                        Mr. Mandip Mukhia of Bhutia Busty, like others, was aware of these practices for a long time. But unlike others, he decided to do something about it. Working as a merchant navy in foreign seas made him conscious of the need to fix this wrong. MBKS, itself as a NGO, receive calls and inquires on daily basis from people wanting to donate clothes, books, stationery and other items. But we didn't have the resources to collect them from individuals around the town.Mr. Mukhia expressed his desire to do something for the homeless who have to fend the cold all by themselves. And voila! An idea was born which was quickly transformed into reality.
                        <br><br>
                        We have set up a "Donation Point" at Chowrashta where citizens can drop off the items they would like to donate including clothes, shoes, books, stationery etc. Our members will collect the items every week and separate the clothes according to their sizes and the books accroding to the standard/class the pertain to. The clothes will then be given to the needy ones at the orphanages and at the old age homes in the Hills. The books will be distributed to the schools in the rural hinterland of the hills to those needy children who can't afford to buy them.
                        We thus urge all the conscious citizens of the town to come and DONATE away any items that you think the needy ones may find a use for at this bin at Chowrashta rather than burning, throwing or selling them away. We thus dedictate this Donation Point by the people of Darjeeling for the people of Darjeeling.
                        <br><br>
                        We would sincerely like to thank Mr. Mandip Mukhia for this great initiative. You are a true son of Darjeeling. We also extend our heartfelt gratitude to Darjeeling Municipality for allowing us to keep the donation bin at Chowrashta and all our members for painting it. We empty the point twice/thrice a week and take them to our office where we segregate it depending on their condition and size. We then distribute it to the remote villages in the Hills and Dooars where people have use for it.
