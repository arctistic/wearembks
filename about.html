            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Mukh Bandh Kaam Suru is a Public Charitable Trust registered under the Indian Trust Act 1960 in Darjeeling, India. We are dedicated towards bringing back the lost essence of Darjeeling Hills. We are involved in Education, Children Healthcare, Youth Empowerment, Poverty Alleviation and Cleanliness sectors. <br>
            </p>
            <h3>
                We basically have five Projects that we are working under right now.
            </h3>
            <p>
                1). Project MEFAI - MBKS Education For All Initiative - As we believe that quality education and access to it shouldn't be the prerogative of a select class of our society, we are running this project to provide educational scholarships to children belonging to the economically deprived families of the Hills right upto their post matriculation examination. We have 44 children under this project right now in eleven different schools across Darjeeling Hills. We bear all their annual educational expenses under MEFAI. The eldest of the lot is in Class Twelve and and the youngest one has just joined Nursery this year. We also have started building educational infrastructure in different schools for advancement of quality education starting with a full-fledged library in Betten High School, Tukvar, Darjeeling. We also conduct the annual GTA Inter-School and GTA Inter-College Quiz in the Hills for the promotion of quizzing acumen among the students. Under this same wing we have MEFAI INFRASTRUCTURE FUND (MIF) which was started for building of basic educational infrastructure in far-flung schools of the Hills. We believe that students have not only the right to education but also the right to quality education. Under this fund, the first project that we completed was the building of a library at Betten High School, Tukvar with the help of Hazaar Sapana, an American NGO. We are also looking after the construction of the new building of the Jimlang Uday Higher Secondary School, Jimlang T.E., after getting it sanctioned from the North Bengal Development Board.
            </p>
            <p>
                2). Project CHILD - Children's Healthcare Initiative For Lifelong Development - Under this we bear the medical expenses of children belonging to financially week section of our society, suffering from chronic diseases. We are currently looking after three children under it. All the cases are in their advanced stage of recovery/treatment due to our timely intervention. We tasted our first success under Project CHILD in 2019 when we successfully got Ms. Shriya Sarki of Ropeway, Singamari, who had a brain tumour in her left cerebrum, operated upon at Bangalore and brought her back to Darjeeling in sound condition.
            </p>
            <p>
                3). Project Donation Point - DoPo - under which we have installed a Donation Point at Chowrashta where people can come and donate their used clothes, shoes, bags, books, toys and any other items. We empty the point twice/thrice a week and take them to our office where we segregate it depending on their condition and size. We then distribute it to the remote villages in the Hills and Dooars where people have use for it.
            </p>
            <p>
                4). Project YuwaUday - For the empowerment and betterment of the youths in the Hills. To this effect, we organize the annual Gorkha Youth Summit in Darjeeling to make the youths more vocal and participative in the national and international issues plaguing them. We also have joined hands with the Darjeeling Police to form an empowered committee of different NGOs named Committee for Eradication of Drug Abuse and Rehabilitation (CEDAR) to combat the menace of drug abuse in the Hills and find curative measures for it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                5). Project Phoenix - Under this we are involved in the sanitation and cleanliness sector in the Hills. We organize cleanliness campaigns and awareness camps to make people more responsible towards their civic duties of keeping their place clean. We have launched a pilot project with Darjeeling Municipality to curb the menace of trash and garbage in the town.
